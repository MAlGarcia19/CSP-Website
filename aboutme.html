    <h2>    My name is Matthew Garica and I am currently a Junior at Damien High School. I currently participate in Track. The middle school I went to was St. George in Ontario where I spent most of my life from Pre-K to 8th grade. I've been coming to Damien Highschool ever since Freshman year and plan to keep coming here until I graduate. I'm the only boy in a family of five. I have an older sister and a younger sister.My mother works in book keeping & is a dialysis technician and my father is a contractor for a large contracting company. Previously I did two years of engineering for my elective but then of course transferred to AP Computer Science in hopes of having at least a rudimentary understanding of coding. </h2>
